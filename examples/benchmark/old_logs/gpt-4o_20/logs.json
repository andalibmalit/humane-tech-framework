Instead, the submission suggests alternative sources that do not replace professional legal advice.\n   - **Additional Suggestions:** The submission goes beyond by suggesting forums and seeking more context, which, while supportive, does not address the core factual content of seeking professional legal advice for complex legal situations.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n    - The submission does not contain the critical factual content that is present in the expert answer: the strong recommendation to consult a qualified attorney. This is a significant omission and impacts the submission's alignment with the expert's guidance.\n\nGiven these points, the submission does not incorporate one of the fundamental aspects of the expert's guidance: the strong recommendation to seek professional legal counsel. Therefore, based on the lack of this essential factual content, the submission must be graded as incorrect.\n\nGRADE: I",
