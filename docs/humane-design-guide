## Overview

The Humane Tech Design Guide provides actionable principles and frameworks for building technology that respects human attention, agency, and well-being. Developed by the Center for Humane Technology, this guide helps designers, developers, and organizations create digital products that align with human values.

## Key Principles

### 1. Protect Attention and Intention
- Design to minimize distractions and interruptions.
- Help users focus on what matters most to them.

### 2. Support Well-being
- Prioritize features that promote emotional and physical health.
- Avoid designs that exploit psychological vulnerabilities.

### 3. Enhance Agency
- Give users meaningful choices and control over their experience.
- Make settings and options transparent and accessible.

### 4. Foster Connection and Empathy
- Encourage positive social interactions and community.
- Reduce features that amplify conflict, anxiety, or isolation.

### 5. Promote Sense-making and Understanding
- Present information clearly and truthfully.
- Help users make informed decisions and avoid misinformation.

### 6. Respect Diversity and Inclusion
- Design for a wide range of backgrounds, abilities, and perspectives.
- Avoid reinforcing bias or exclusion.

## Design Patterns

- **Batched Notifications:** Group notifications to reduce interruptions and support deep work.
- **Time Well Spent:** Encourage mindful usage and provide feedback on time spent.
- **User Agency Tools:** Offer granular controls for privacy, data, and content preferences.
- **Transparent Algorithms:** Explain how recommendations and feeds are generated.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Audit Existing Products:** Assess current features for alignment with humane principles.
2. **Engage Stakeholders:** Involve users, designers, and ethicists in the design process.
3. **Prototype and Test:** Build and evaluate features that support well-being and agency.
4. **Iterate and Improve:** Use feedback and research to refine humane design practices.
