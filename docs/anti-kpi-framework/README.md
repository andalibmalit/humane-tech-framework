Deep Dive: Anti-KPI Templates for Humane Technology

Expanded Anti-KPI Framework

Core Philosophy
Anti-KPIs are failure metrics that help you track when your success is causing harm elsewhere. Think of them as your product's immune system - they detect when growth becomes cancerous rather than healthy.

Comprehensive Anti-KPI Categories & Examples

1. User Wellbeing & Mental Health

Primary KPI → Anti-KPI Pairings

Research Foundation
Studies show people who share political content are 60% worse at estimating others' beliefs. This perception gap widens when extreme voices are amplified over moderate ones.

Advanced Anti-KPI Implementation

Common Implementation Challenges & Solutions

Challenge: "Anti-KPIs might hurt our growth"
Solution: Frame as sustainable growth vs. unsustainable extraction. Companies with strong anti-KPI practices often have higher long-term retention and user satisfaction.

Challenge: "These metrics are too subjective"
Solution: Combine quantitative behavioral data with qualitative user feedback. Use multiple measurement methods for validation.

Challenge: "Our stakeholders won't understand"
Solution: Present anti-KPIs as risk management and brand protection. Frame as "quality assurance for user experience."

Challenge: "We don't have resources to track everything"
Solution: Start with one anti-KPI per major KPI. Build measurement infrastructure gradually. Use automated detection where possible.

The anti-KPI framework isn't about limiting growth—it's about ensuring that growth creates value rather than destroying it. When implemented thoughtfully, anti-KPIs help build products that users genuinely love rather than feel trapped by.
