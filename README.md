# Humane Technology Framework

A collection of tools, guidelines, and resources for building technology that respects human well-being, autonomy, and dignity.

## What is Humane Technology?

Humane technology is technology that supports human flourishing, minimizes harm, and creates positive outcomes. It is built with an awareness of our capacity for distraction and anxiety, and aims to:
- Respect user attention
- Promote digital well-being
- Foster meaningful connection
- Protect privacy and dignity

This framework is inspired by the principles and thinking of [buildinghumanetech.com](https://www.buildinghumanetech.com/).

### Promises of Humane Technology
When you interact with humane tech, it should make you feel:
- **Cared for:** Your needs are at the center of the experience.
- **Present:** You feel more present in body and mind.
- **Fulfilled:** You are satisfied with your experience and outcomes.
- **Connected:** You connect to yourself, others, or nature.
